# Judge-O-Matic
## The Machine Learning Personality Analyzer  
## What is it?
The Judge-O-Matic uses the IBM Watson Cloud Personality Insights API to evalutate uploaded text on five main personality traits and 30 subtraits. The traits are raw scored on a scale fom 0 to 1.0. Raw scores are available from the API, as well as a percentile score that is normalized by the service by comparing the raw score with a similar population in the Personality Service's database. 

For the purposes of this app, only the Raw Scores have been used, as the normalized scores tend to mute or attenutate the personality characteristics making them a bit less... compelling.
